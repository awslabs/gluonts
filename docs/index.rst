Welcome to GluonTS!
===================

GluonTS is a Python package for probabilistic time series modeling, focusing on deep learning models.

Features
--------

* State-of-the-art models implemented with `MXNet <https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/>`_ and `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_
* Easy AWS integration via `Amazon SageMaker <https://aws.amazon.com/de/sagemaker/>`_
* Utilities for loading and iterating over time series datasets
* Utilities to evaluate models performance and compare their accuracy
* Building blocks to define custom models and quickly experiment

Installation
------------

GluonTS requires Python 3.7+, and the easiest way to install it is via ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install --upgrade gluonts mxnet~=1.8   # to be able to use MXNet-based models
   pip install --upgrade gluonts torch~=1.10  # to be able to use PyTorch-based models

See :doc:`install` for more detailed installation instructions, including optional dependencies.
See :doc:`community/devsetup` for setup instructions in case you want to develop GluonTS.
