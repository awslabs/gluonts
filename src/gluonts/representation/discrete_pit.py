class DiscretePIT(Representation):
    """
    A class representing a discrete probability integral transform of a given quantile-based learned binning.

    Parameters
    ----------
    learned_binning
        The underlying binning. This needs to be quantile-based, i.e. is_quantile needs to be True.    
    mlp_tranf
        Whether we want to post-process the pit-transformed valued using a MLP which can learn an appropriate
        binning, which would ensure that pit models have the same expressiveness as standard quantile binning with
        embedding.
        (default: False)
    embedding_size
        The desired layer output size if mlp_tranf=True.
        (default: round(num_bins**(1/4)))
