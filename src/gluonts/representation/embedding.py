class Embedding(Representation):
    """
    A class representing an embedding operation on top of a given binning.
    Note that this representation is intended to applied on top of categorical/binned data.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    num_bins
        The number of categories/bins of the data on which this representation is applied.
    size
        The desired embedding size. By default, the following heuristic is used:
