    A `Forecast` object that uses a distribution directly.

    This can for instance be used to represent marginal probability

    Parameters
    ----------
    distribution
        Distribution object. This should represent the entire prediction
        length, i.e., if we draw `num_samples` samples from the distribution,
        the sample shape should be

            samples = trans_dist.sample(num_samples)
            samples.shape -> (num_samples, prediction_length)

    start_date
        start of the forecast
    info
        additional information that the forecaster may provide e.g. estimated
        parameters, number of iterations ran etc.
