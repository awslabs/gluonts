### Change config
Find the config in "config" folder. Choose the config you need and Set "opt.use_visdom" to "True".

### Start visdom server on gpu machine
    python -m visdom.server -p 2000
Now connect your computer with the gpu server and forward the port 2000 to your local computer. You can now go to:
    http://localhost:xxx(Your local address)
