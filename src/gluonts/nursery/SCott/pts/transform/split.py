class InstanceSplitter(FlatMapTransformation):
    """
    Selects training instances, by slicing the target and other time series
    like arrays at random points in training mode or at the last time point in
    prediction mode. Assumption is that all time like arrays start at the same
    time point.

    The target and each time_series_field is removed and instead two
    corresponding fields with prefix `past_` and `future_` are included. E.g.

    If the target array is one-dimensional, the resulting instance has shape
    (len_target). In the multi-dimensional case, the instance has shape (dim,
    len_target).

    target -> past_target and future_target

    The transformation also adds a field 'past_is_pad' that indicates whether
    values where padded or not.

    Convention: time axis is always the last axis.

    Parameters
    ----------

    target_field
        field containing the target
    is_pad_field
        output field indicating whether padding happened
    start_field

    forecast_start_field
        output field that will contain the time point where the forecast starts
    train_sampler
        instance sampler that provides sampling indices given a time-series
    past_length
        length of the target seen before making prediction
    future_length
        length of the target that must be predicted
    time_first
        whether to have time series output in (time, dimension) or in
        (dimension, time) layout
    time_series_fields
        fields that contains time-series, they are split in the same interval

    pick_incomplete
        whether training examples can be sampled with only a part of
        past_length time-units
        present for the time series. This is useful to train models for
        cold-start. In such case, is_pad_out contains an indicator whether

    Selects instances, by slicing the target and other time series
    like arrays at random points in training mode or at the last time point in
    prediction mode. Assumption is that all time like arrays start at the same
    time point.

    In training mode, the returned instances contain past_`target_field`
    as well as past_`time_series_fields`.

    In prediction mode, one can set `use_prediction_features` to get
    future_`time_series_fields`.

    If the target array is one-dimensional, the `target_field` in the resulting instance has shape
    (`instance_length`). In the multi-dimensional case, the instance has shape (`dim`, `instance_length`),
    where `dim` can also take a value of 1.

    In the case of insufficient number of time series values, the
    transformation also adds a field 'past_is_pad' that indicates whether
    values where padded or not, and the value is padded with
    `default_pad_value` with a default value 0.
    This is done only if `allow_target_padding` is `True`,

class ContinuousTimeInstanceSplitter(FlatMapTransformation):
    """
    Selects training instances by slicing "intervals" from a continuos-time
    process instantiation. Concretely, the input data is expected to describe an
    instantiation from a point (or jump) process, with the "target"
    identifying inter-arrival times and other features (marks), as described
    in detail below.

    The splitter will then take random points in continuous time from each
    given observation, and return a (variable-length) array of points in
    the past (context) and the future (prediction) intervals.

    The transformation is analogous to its discrete counterpart
    `InstanceSplitter` except that

    - It does not allow "incomplete" records. That is, the past and future
      intervals sampled are always complete
    - Outputs a (T, C) layout.
    - Does not accept `time_series_fields` (i.e., only accepts target fields) as these
      would typically not be available in TPP data.

    The target arrays are expected to have (2, T) layout where the first axis
    corresponds to the (i) interarrival times between consecutive points, in
    order and (ii) integer identifiers of marks (from {0, 1, ..., :code:`num_marks`}).
    The returned arrays will have (T, 2) layout.

    For example, the array below corresponds to a target array where points with timestamps
    0.5, 1.1, and 1.5 were observed belonging to categories (marks) 3, 1 and 0
    respectively: :code:`[[0.5, 0.6, 0.4], [3, 1, 0]]`.
