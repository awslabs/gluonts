    """
    Exponential weighted moving average used for calculating a scale on a stream of data.

    We consider a value as "valid" if it is not NaN and has a magnitude larger than
    minimum_value. The scle is update when a value is "valid", until the first valid
    observation is passed, the scale returned is given by `initial_scale`.

    NOTE: The value x[i] at time i contributes to the scale[i] at the same time point.
    When used for forecasting models, make sure to take this into account to avoid leakage
    across time.


    Parameters
    ==========
    x
        1d array of float type
    alpha
        Smoothing factor used:
            w[i] = (1-alpha) * w[i-1] + alpha * x[i].
    minimum_value
        Minimum value that a data point has to have to be considered "valid"
    initial_scale
        Value of initial scale to use until the first "valid" data point.
    state
        State used to continue calculation.
        The state is a numpy array of length 2.

    Returns
    =======
    y
        result of averaging
    state
        state that can be used for continuing calculation
