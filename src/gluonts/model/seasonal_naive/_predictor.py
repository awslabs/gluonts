class SeasonalNaivePredictor(RepresentablePredictor):
    """
    Seasonal naÃ¯ve forecaster.

    For each time series :math:`y`, this predictor produces a forecast
    :math:`\\tilde{y}(T+k) = y(T+k-h)`, where :math:`T` is the forecast time,
    :math:`k = 0, ...,` `prediction_length - 1`, and :math:`h =`
    `season_length`.

    If `prediction_length > season_length`, then the season is repeated
    multiple times. If a time series is shorter than season_length, then the
    mean observed value is used as prediction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq
        Frequency of the input data
    prediction_length
        Number of time points to predict
    season_length
        Length of the seasonality pattern of the input data
