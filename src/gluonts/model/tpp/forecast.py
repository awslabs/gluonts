class PointProcessSampleForecast(Forecast):
    """
    Sample forecast object used for temporal point process inference.
    Differs from standard forecast objects as it does not implement
    fixed length samples. Each sample has a variable length, that is
    kept in a separate :code:`valid_length` attribute.

    Importantly, PointProcessSampleForecast does not implement some
    methods (such as :code:`quantile` or :code:`plot`) that are available
    in discrete time forecasts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples
        A multidimensional array of samples, of shape
        (number_of_samples, max_pred_length, target_dim). The target_dim is
        equal to 2, where the first dimension contains the inter-arrival times
        and the second - categorical marks.
    valid_length
        An array of integers denoting the valid lengths of each sample
        in :code:`samples`. That is, :code:`valid_length[0] == 2` implies
        that only the first two entries of :code:`samples[0, ...]` are
        valid "points".
    start_date
        Starting timestamp of the sample
    freq
        The time unit of interarrival times
    prediction_interval_length
        The length of the prediction interval for which samples were drawn.
    item_id
        Item ID, if available.
    info
        Optional dictionary of additional information.
