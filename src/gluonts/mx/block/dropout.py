class VariationalZoneoutCell(ModifierCell):
    """
    Applies Variational Zoneout on base cell.
    The implementation follows [GG16]_.
    Variational zoneout uses the same mask across time-steps. It can be applied to RNN
    outputs, and states. The masks for them are not shared.

    The mask is initialized when stepping forward for the first time and will remain
    the same until .reset() is called. Thus, if using the cell and stepping manually without calling
    .unroll(), the .reset() should be called after each sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_cell
        The cell on which to perform variational dropout.
    zoneout_outputs
        The dropout rate for outputs. Won't apply dropout if it equals 0.
    zoneout_states
        The dropout rate for state inputs on the first state channel.
        Won't apply dropout if it equals 0.
