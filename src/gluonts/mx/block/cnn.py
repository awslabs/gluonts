class CausalConv1D(gluon.HybridBlock):
    """
    1D causal temporal convolution, where the term causal means that output[t]
    does not depend on input[t+1:]. Notice that Conv1D is not implemented in
    Gluon.

    This is the basic structure used in Wavenet [ODZ+16]_ and Temporal
    Convolution Network [BKK18]_.

    The output has the same shape as the input, while we always left-pad zeros.

    Parameters
    ----------

    channels
        The dimensionality of the output space, i.e. the number of output
        channels (filters) in the convolution.

    kernel_size
        Specifies the dimensions of the convolution window.

    dilation
        Specifies the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution.

    activation
        Activation function to use. See :func:`~mxnet.ndarray.Activation`.
        If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
        (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
