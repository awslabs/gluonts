class DiscretePIT(Representation):
    """
    A class representing a discrete probability integral transform of a given
    quantile-based learned binning.  Note that this representation is intended
    to be applied on top of a quantile-based binning representation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_bins
        Number of bins used by the data on which this representation is
        applied.
    mlp_tranf
        Whether we want to post-process the pit-transformed valued using a MLP
        which can learn an appropriate binning, which would ensure that pit
        models have the same expressiveness as standard quantile binning with
        embedding.
        (default: False)
    embedding_size
        The desired layer output size if mlp_tranf=True. By default, the
        following heuristic is used:
